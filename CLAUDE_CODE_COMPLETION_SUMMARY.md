## Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: VRAM Probing Mock Test Failure
**File**: tests/test_memory_manager_model_cache.py
**Issue**: Test expected 4.0GB but got 8.0GB
**Root Cause**: torch.cuda.is_available() not mocked, defaulting to False
**Fix**: Added `patch('torch.cuda.is_available', return_value=True)`
**Commit**: 3aafd67 - "fix(tests): mock torch.cuda.is_available() in VRAM probing test"
