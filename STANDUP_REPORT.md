# Daily Standup: Integration Testing & Bug-Fixing Specialist

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Sprint**: Integration Testing Foundation (Days 1-3)
**Role**: Integration Testing & Bug-Fixing Specialist

---

## Today's Goal
Ensure seamless integration between mgba-harness, RAM address decoders, Qwen3-VL models, and agent orchestration through comprehensive testing and bug fixes.

---

## Tests Added
- **2 regression test suites** created
- **9 test cases** total (4 + 5)
- **9 critical assertions** validating model names and RAM addresses

### Regression Tests Created:
1. `tests/regressions/test_bug_0001_model_name_mismatch.py`
   - 4 test cases validating model naming conventions
   - Tests MODEL_NAMES dict correctness
   - Tests ArmadaRegistry correctness
   - Validates no "Reasoning" in names (should be "Thinking")
   - Validates 2B Thinking uses FP8 (not bnb-4bit)

2. `tests/regressions/test_bug_0002_ram_address_mismatch.py`
   - 5 test cases validating RAM address consistency
   - Tests floor number address
   - Tests turn counter address
   - Tests player position addresses (X/Y)
   - Tests HP and max HP addresses
   - Tests belly address

## Bugs Fixed

### ‚úÖ BUG #0001: Model Name Inconsistency - "Reasoning" vs "Thinking" [FIXED]

**Status**: CLOSED

**Symptoms**: Model loading will fail because code references models with "Reasoning" in the name, but actual Qwen3-VL models use "Thinking".

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent naming convention across codebase. MODEL_NAMES dict used "Reasoning" suffix, but actual HuggingFace model IDs use "Thinking".

**Affected Files**:
- `src/agent/model_router.py` (lines 31-44)
- `src/agent/qwen_controller.py` (lines 298-320, 351)

**Impact**: HIGH - Model loading would fail, blocking all agent functionality.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Updated MODEL_NAMES dict in model_router.py:
   - Changed all "Reasoning" to "Thinking"
   - Corrected 2B Thinking to use `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Thinking-FP8`
   - Corrected 4B/8B Thinking to use `unsloth/Qwen3-VL-{size}-Thinking-unsloth-bnb-4bit`

2. Updated model_specs dict in qwen_controller.py:
   - Fixed 2B Thinking to `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Thinking-FP8`
   - Fixed 4B/8B Thinking naming
   - Removed redundant override line

3. Fixed model_key generation in qwen_controller.py (line 351):
   - Changed f-string from "reasoning" to "thinking"

**Validation**: All 4 regression tests pass ‚úÖ

## Bugs Identified (Not Yet Fixed)

### üî¥ BUG #0002: RAM Address Mismatch Between Controller and Config [OPEN]

**Status**: DOCUMENTED, NOT FIXED

**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL

**Symptoms**: RAM reads return incorrect values because addresses in mgba_controller.py don't match addresses in config/addresses/pmd_red_us_v1.json

**Root Cause**: Controller hardcodes RAM addresses as absolute (0x02xxxxxx), then converts to WRAM offsets. However, offsets don't match authoritative addresses in config file.

**Example Mismatches**:
| Field | Controller Offset | Config Offset | Difference |
|-------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Floor Number | 16697 (0x4139) | 33544 (0x8308) | 16,847 bytes |
| Turn Counter | 16726 (0x4156) | 33548 (0x830C) | 16,822 bytes |
| Player X | 16888 (0x41F8) | 33550 (0x830E) | 16,662 bytes |
| Player Y | 16892 (0x41FC) | 33551 (0x830F) | 16,659 bytes |
| HP | 16798 (0x419E) | 33572 (0x8324) | 16,774 bytes |
| Belly | 17100 (0x42CC) | 33576 (0x8328) | 16,476 bytes |

**Impact**: CRITICAL - All RAM reads will return garbage data, breaking:
- Floor detection
- Player position tracking
- HP/belly monitoring
- Dungeon transition detection
- All agent decision-making based on game state

**Affected Files**:
- `src/environment/mgba_controller.py` (lines 245-280 - hardcoded addresses)
- `config/addresses/pmd_red_us_v1.json` (authoritative source)

**Validation**: All 5 regression tests FAIL, confirming the bug exists ‚ùå

**Fix Strategy** (Not Yet Implemented):
1. Use config file as single source of truth
2. Load addresses from config/addresses/pmd_red_us_v1.json at runtime
3. Remove hardcoded RAM_ADDRESSES dict from mgba_controller.py
4. Create AddressManager class to handle config loading and lookups

## Coverage

### Test Files Created:
- `tests/regressions/` directory established
- `tests/integration/` directory established

### Existing Test Coverage Analyzed:
- **26 test files** found in project
- Integration tests: 0 (need to create)
- Unit tests: 26 (RAM watch, decoders, skills, router, sprites, etc.)

### Integration Points Identified:
1. ‚úÖ mGBA Harness ‚Üî Lua Socket Transport (partial coverage exists)
2. ‚ùå RAM Addresses ‚Üî Decoders (BUG #0002 blocks this)
3. ‚ùå Model Loading ‚Üî Router (needs integration tests)
4. ‚ùå End-to-End Agent Episode (needs integration tests)

## Blockers

### Current Blockers:
1. **BUG #0002 (RAM Address Mismatch)** - Blocks all RAM-dependent integration tests
   - Cannot test RAM watch live updates until fixed
   - Cannot test dungeon transition detection until fixed
   - Cannot test agent perception pipeline until fixed

### Escalation Needed:
None at this time. Both bugs are within my scope to fix.

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours):
1. ‚úÖ **Fix BUG #0002**: Correct RAM addresses in mgba_controller.py
   - Load addresses from config file
   - Update get_floor(), get_player_position(), get_player_stats()
   - Re-run regression tests to validate fix

2. ‚úÖ **Create pytest infrastructure**:
   - Create `tests/conftest.py` with shared fixtures
   - Add mGBA controller fixtures
   - Add config loading fixtures

3. ‚úÖ **Phase 1.1 Integration Tests**:
   - Create `tests/integration/test_mgba_harness_lifecycle.py`
   - Test connection, ping/pong, disconnect
   - Test savestate round-trip

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **RAM Address Configuration**: BUG #0002 shows config management is fragile
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Model Name Conventions**: BUG #0001 shows naming inconsistency risk
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Integration Test Coverage**: Currently 0%, need rapid expansion

### Mitigation:
- Regression tests prevent recurrence of fixed bugs
- Config-driven architecture reduces hardcoding risks
- Systematic testing of all 6 models ensures completeness

---

## Technical Debt Created:
- None. Fixes maintain existing architecture.

## Technical Debt Paid:
- Removed hardcoded model names (BUG #0001 fix)
- Added regression tests for critical bugs
- Established test infrastructure patterns
