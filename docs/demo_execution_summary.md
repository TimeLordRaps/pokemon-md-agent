# Demo Execution Summary

Generated: 2025-10-31T00:00:00Z

Status: placeholder â€” demo video exists but montage generation step may require verification.

Artifacts:

- Video: `docs/assets/agent_demo.mp4`
- Narration: `docs/assets/voiceover.wav` (if present)
- Montage stats: `docs/demo_execution_summary.json`

Notes:
- GitHub Pages scaffold `docs/index.html` present and references the MP4.
- Current GitHub Pages returns 404 (may require enabling Pages in repository settings or waiting for Pages to build).

Next steps:
- Verify the MP4 plays locally and is non-black (FFprobe validation).
- Run `scripts/generate_montage_video.py` to (re)generate a validated montage with narration.
- Ensure final artifacts are committed to `docs/` and pushed to `main` branch.
