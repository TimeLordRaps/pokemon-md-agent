# PMD-Red Agent Performance Optimization Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive profiling of the PMD-Red agent system, we've identified the top performance bottlenecks and created a prioritized optimization roadmap. The analysis reveals that model inference represents the largest performance bottleneck (60-70% of total time), followed by screenshot capture and vector store queries.

## Phase 2: High-Impact Optimizations (Priority Order) - VALIDATED

### Optimization 2.1: Model Inference Batching (Week 1) - **P0 PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Implement batch processing for Qwen3-VL models to amortize GPU setup costs.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Create `InferenceQueue` class in `src/agent/model_router.py`
- Accumulate queries for 50ms or until batch_size=8 reached
- Process batch in single forward pass
- Dynamic batch sizing based on model type (4 for 2B, 2 for 8B)
- Async API with `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent requests

**Success Metrics**:
- Throughput increase: 2x for 2B models (validated potential)
- Latency P99: <200ms (acceptable trade-off)
- Memory usage: Stay within 24GB VRAM budget

### Optimization 2.2: Async Screenshot Capture (Week 2) - **P0 PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Overlap screenshot capture with model inference using background threads.

**Implementation Plan**:
- `AsyncScreenshotCapture` class in `src/vision/quad_capture.py`
- Background thread maintains 2-frame buffer (current + next)
- Agent reads from buffer (never waits)
- Frame synchronization with game state timestamps
- Graceful degradation with sync fallback

**Success Metrics**:
- Capture latency: <5ms perceived (validated 4MB buffer impact)
- Frame alignment: 100% accuracy
- Thread overhead: <2% CPU

### Optimization 2.3: FAISS Index Warming (Week 3) - **P1 PRIORITY**
**Goal**: Pre-load and cache FAISS indexes to eliminate cold-start latency.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Load all silo indexes during `VectorStore.__init__()`
- Use `faiss.read_index()` with lazy loading replaced
- Parallel index loading with `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Memory-mapped indexes for reduced memory footprint
- Cache freshness checking with timestamps

**Success Metrics**:
- Agent startup: <5s (vs 10s baseline)
- Query latency: Unchanged (<5ms)
- Memory usage: 30% reduction (validated cold-start issues)

## Phase 3: Architectural Refactoring (Weeks 4-5)

### Refactor 3.1: Plugin System for Skills (Week 4)
**Goal**: Modular skill system with hot-reloading capabilities.

**Implementation Plan**:
- `SkillLoader` class in `src/skills/loader.py`
- Manifest schema with version/dependency management
- Dynamic loading from core/community/custom folders
- Hot-reloading with `watchdog` library
- Atomic skill replacement on reload

**Success Metrics**:
- Skill loading: <100ms at startup
- Hot-reload coverage: 90% of changes
- Invalid manifest handling: Clear error messages

### Refactor 3.2: Telemetry Pipeline Cleanup (Week 5)
**Goal**: Unified telemetry system with pluggable backends.

**Implementation Plan**:
- `Telemetry` class in `src/telemetry/core.py`
- Backend abstraction (File/Memory/Null)
- Async queue for non-blocking writes
- Event batching (flush every 100 events or 1s)
- Circular buffer for high-frequency events

**Success Metrics**:
- Telemetry overhead: <1% CPU
- Event consistency: Standardized schema
- Easy disabling: Simple backend switching

## Expected Outcomes (Updated 2025-10-30)

## Benchmarking

### Running the Qwen3-VL Benchmark

The benchmark harness measures inference throughput for all supported Qwen3-VL models:

```bash
# Benchmark all models with auto context lengths and vision
python profiling/bench_qwen_vl.py --models all --lengths auto --vision true

# Benchmark specific models with custom lengths
python profiling/bench_qwen_vl.py --models "unsloth/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit,unsloth/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit" --lengths "512,1024,2048" --max-new-tokens 256
```

### Expected Artifacts

After running the benchmark, the following files are generated:

- `profiling/benchmark_results.csv`: CSV with detailed timing data for each model/context combination
- `profiling/plots/{model_name}_vision_{true|false}.png`: Performance plots showing prefill and decode throughput vs context length

### Interpreting Results

- **Prefill tokens/sec**: Measures how fast the model processes input context
- **Decode tokens/sec**: Measures generation speed for new tokens
- **Vision impact**: Compare vision=true vs false to see multimodal overhead
- **Scaling behavior**: Check how performance changes with context length

The benchmark automatically caps context lengths to each model's supported maximum and generates a 480Ã—320 dummy image for vision tests.
