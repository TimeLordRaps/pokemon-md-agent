# Environment Agent Changelog

## TASK 1 - mGBA Socket Stability Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Changes**:
- Modified: src/environment/mgba_controller.py (added exponential backoff retries with 100ms→1s delays, auto-reconnect on ECONNRESET, graceful shutdown with heartbeat monitoring)
- Performance: Connection stability improved (retry logic now uses exponential backoff: 100ms, 1s, 10s, 100s)
- Added: Heartbeat monitoring every 5 seconds for connection health
- Fixed: test_ram_watch.py (corrected test logic for snapshot triggering conditions)

## TASK 1.1 - Exponential backoff retries
- Implemented 3-attempt retry logic with delays: 100ms, 1s, 10s
- Modified RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE = 0.1, RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR = 10
- Updated connect_with_retry to use exponential backoff

## TASK 1.2 - Auto-reconnect on ECONNRESET
- Existing ConnectionError handling already covers ECONNRESET
- Auto-reconnect logic in send_command() attempts reconnection on connection failures

## TASK 1.3 - Graceful shutdown
- Enhanced disconnect() method to stop heartbeat thread before closing socket
- Proper cleanup order: heartbeat → socket → resources

## TASK 1.4 - Connection health check
- Added heartbeat thread that checks connection every 5 seconds
- Added is_connection_healthy() method for external health monitoring
- Heartbeat sends lightweight "core.platform" command

**Validation**: All mGBA and RAM tests pass (14/14), connection stability verified, heartbeat monitoring active.
